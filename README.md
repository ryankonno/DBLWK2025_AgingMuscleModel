# DBLWK2025_AgingMuscleModel

Aging has a broad range of alterations to muscle-tendon structure and function. To understand the underlying consequences on muscle mechanics, modelling approaches can be used. This code used to demonstrate the role of aging on the muscle force-velocity relationship and corresponding energetics through the alteration of muscle fibre-type composition and force generating capacity. The code was used to generate Figure 4 in
